### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught programmer with a decade of experience developing video games from top to bottom -- from high-level scripting to low-level game engine tools and systems, including graphics, networking, animation, and build pipelines.

#### Check out some cool stuff I'm working on:
- [Team Fortress 2: Panda3D](https://github.com/TF-Panda)
- [The Player (A custom Panda3D fork)](https://github.com/toontownretro)
#### And some stuff I've worked on in the past:
- [Source Engine Direct3D 11 Renderer](https://github.com/quiverteam/Engine/tree/dx11/src/materialsystem/shaderapidx11)
- [School Inventory Management Software](https://github.com/lachbr/lhs-cat-tablet-inventory)
